# twittler
This is a project I completed as part of the precourse material for [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

This was a mostly-empty repo, with a file called data_generator.js that creates some data that represents twitter users and their tweets. It's the data you would expect to see if you had created a twitter account and followed a few people. (More tweets appear over time.)

I implemented the following features:
* Show the user new tweets somehow. (You can show them automatically as they're created, or create a button that displays new tweets.)
* Display the timestamps of when the tweets were created. This timestamp should reflect the actual time the tweets were created, and should not just be hardcoded.
* Design your interface so that you want to look at and use the product you're making.
* Allow the user to click on a username to see that user's timeline.
* Show when the tweets were created in a human-friendly way (eg "10 minutes ago"). You'll want to find and use a library for this.
